      <div class="list-name"> The following list is a time line of Franck 
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li> <span class="year">1822</span> - He was born in Liège (which at the time of his birth was part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands).
        </li>

        <li> <span class="year">1834</span> - César-Auguste gave his first concerts, one before Leopold I of the newly formed Kingdom of Belgium.
        </li>

        <li> <span class="year">1835</span> - His father resolved that the time had come for wider audiences, and brought César-Auguste and his younger brother Joseph to Paris, to study privately.
        </li>

        <li> <span class="year">1837</span> - Young Franck and his brother entered the Conservatoire, César-Auguste continuing his piano studies under Zimmerman and beginning composition with Aimé Leborn.
        </li>

        <li> <span class="year">1841</span> - He added organ studies with François Benoist, which included both performance and improvisation, taking second prize.
        </li>

        <li> <span class="year">1842</span> - The young Franck compelled the latter to leave the Conservatoire and accompany Nicolas-Joseph.
        </li>

        <li> <span class="year">1843</span> - In 1843, Franck began work on his first non-chamber work, the oratorio Ruth.
        </li>

        <li> <span class="year">1847</span> - Franck had wanted an organist's position, not least because it provided a steady income. He now had occasion to match his Roman Catholic devotion with learning the skills needed for accompanying public worship.
        </li>

        <li> <span class="year">1858</span> - He became organist and maître de chapelle at the newly consecrated Sainte-Clotilde. 
        </li>

        <li> <span class="year">1862</span> - His increasing reputation as both performer and improviser continued to make Franck much in demand for inaugural or dedicatory recitals of new or rebuilt Cavaillé-Coll organs. 
        </li>

        <li> <span class="year">1869</span> - Franck continued to write compositions for choir in this period, but most were never published. 
        </li>

        <li> <span class="year">1872</span> - Franck's reputation was now widespread enough, through his fame as performer, his membership in the Société, and his smaller but devoted group of students, that when Benoist retired as professor of organ at the reopening of the Paris Conservatoire in 1872, Franck was proposed as successor.  
        </li>

        <li> <span class="year">1886</span> - In 1886 Franck composed the Violin Sonata as a wedding gift for the Belgian violinist Eugène Ysaÿe.  
        </li>

        <li> <span class="year">1888</span> - The dissension between Franck's family and his circle of students reached a new height when Franck published Psyché, D minor. 
        </li>

        <li> <span class="year">1888</span> - Franck successfully tried his hand again at another opera, Ghiselle.  
        </li>

        <li> <span class="year">1890</span> - Franck started the new term at the Conservatoire in October, but caught a cold mid-month. 
        This turned into pleurisy complicated by pericarditis. After that, his condition rapidly worsened and he died on 8 November. 
        </li>
